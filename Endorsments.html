            <li><p>“I have worked for Garry for the past three years and in that time, as my manager, he has always given excellent support when needed and provided a good working environment for myself and our team. He has a wealth of valuable experience within both the Pharmaceutical and MD&D industries which he is able to communicate very effectively at all levels. Garry's focus on getting the job done on time and in a compliant manner is very impressive. I have no hesitation at all in recommending Garry as he has proven on many an occasion that he is a consummate professional that would be an asset for any company, and i wish him well for the future.” - Philip Carr, reported directly to Garry in 2010
